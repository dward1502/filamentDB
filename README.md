# filamentDB
The FIlament Database is a website that is created to create an online database for the variety of 3d FDM filaments that are in the world. Can be used for users of 3d FDM printers to easily asses and pick the write filament to be used for the project. Currently there is no general database of this information and it is hard to compare different filaments to one and another.
